# Rangenet Library

This repository contains simple usage explanations of how the RangeNet++ inference works with the TensorRT and C++ interface.

Developed by [Xieyuanli Chen](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/people/xieyuanli-chen/), [Andres Milioto](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/people/andres-milioto/) and [Jens Behley](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/people/jens-behley/).

## How to use

#### Dependencies

##### System dependencies
First you need to install the nvidia driver and CUDA.

- CUDA Installation guide: [Link](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html)

- Then you can do the other dependencies:

  ```sh
  $ sudo apt-get update 
  $ sudo apt-get install -yqq  build-essential python3-dev python3-pip apt-utils git cmake libboost-all-dev libyaml-cpp-dev libopencv-dev
  ```
  
##### Python dependencies

- Then install the Python packages needed:

  ```sh
  $ sudo apt install python-empy
  $ sudo pip install catkin_tools trollius numpy
  ```
  
##### TensorRT

In order to infer with TensorRT during inference with the C++ libraries:

- Install TensorRT: [Link](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt).
- Our code and the pretrained model now only works with **TensorRT version 5** (Note that you need at least version 5.1.0).
- To make the code also works for higher versions of TensorRT, one could have a look at [here](https://github.com/PRBonn/rangenet_lib/issues/9).

#### Build the library
We use the catkin tool to build the library.

  ```sh
  $ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
  $ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
  $ git clone https://github.com/ros/catkin.git 
  $ git clone https://github.com/PRBonn/rangenet_lib.git
  $ cd .. && catkin init
  $ catkin build rangenet_lib
  ```

#### Run the demo

To run the demo, you need a pre-trained model, which can be downloaded here, [model](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/html/projects/semantic_suma/darknet53.tar.gz). 

A single LiDAR scan for running the demo, you could find in the example folder `example/000000.bin`. For more LiDAR data, you could download from [KITTI odometry dataset](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php).

For more details about how to train and evaluate a model, please refer to [LiDAR-Bonnetal](https://github.com/PRBonn/lidar-bonnetal).

To infer a single LiDAR scan and visualize the semantic point cloud:

  ```sh
  # go to the root path of the catkin workspace
  $ cd ~/catkin_ws
  # use --verbose or -v to get verbose mode
  $ ./devel/lib/rangenet_lib/infer -h # help
  $ ./devel/lib/rangenet_lib/infer -p /path/to/the/pretrained/model -s /path/to/the/scan.bin --verbose
  ```

**Notice**: for the first time running, it will take several minutes to generate a `.trt` model for C++ interface.

## Applications
#### Efficient LiDAR-based Semantic SLAM
Using rangenet_lib, we built a LiDAR-based Semantic SLAM system, called SuMa++.

You could find more implementation details in [SuMa++](https://github.com/PRBonn/semantic_suma/).

#### LiDAR-based Semantic Loop Closing
OverlapNet is a LiDAR-based loop closure detection method, which uses multiple cues generated from LiDAR scans.

More information about our OverlapNet could be found [here](https://github.com/PRBonn/OverlapNet).

One could use our rangenet_lib to generate probabilities over semantic classes for training OverlapNet.

More detailed steps and discussion could be found [here](https://github.com/PRBonn/rangenet_lib/issues/31).
